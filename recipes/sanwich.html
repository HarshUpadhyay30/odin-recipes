    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>The grilled cheese is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by heating slices of cheese between slices of 
        bread with a cooking fat such as butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until 
        the bread browns and the cheese melts.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices white bread</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. 
            Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on 
            one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</li>
        <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. 
            Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</li>
    </ol>
