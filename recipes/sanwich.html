        <h1>Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h1>
        
        <h2>Description: </h2>
        <p>The grilled cheese is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by heating slices of cheese between slices of 
            bread with a cooking fat such as butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until 
            the bread browns and the cheese melts.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices white bread</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. 
                Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on 
                one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</li>
            <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. 
                Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</li>
        </ol>
